### Features
Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing a username, password, and initial balance.<br>
Login: Registered users can enter their username and password, with an additional captcha for security.<br>
Banking Operations: Once logged in, users can perform the following operations:<br>
Deposit: Add funds to their account.<br>
Withdraw: Take money out of their account.<br>
Fund Transfer: Send money to another user's account.<br>
Check Current Balance: View their account's current balance.<br>
Exit: Leave the program.
### Code Structure
The program is organized into functions for each banking operation.<br>
The user details are stored in the dictionary 'account_details'. A new user can create an account and log in. A captcha will be generated for enhanced security. The user can perform the banking operations and also view the current balance.
### Note
This code does not implement advanced security measures found in real banking systems and hence cannot be used for real transactions.<br>
User data is not persistently stored; it is lost when the program terminates.
